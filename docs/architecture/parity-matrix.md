# Renderer parity matrix

Status: living document, required by Phase 0 of
[monorepo-migration.md](./monorepo-migration.md)  
Generated from the exports of `src/index.ts` (Vue), `src/react/index.ts`
(React), and `src/core` on 2026-07-12 (`feat/monorepo`, base `d859bed`).

A row is *complete* when both renderers consume the same core/dom
implementation, pass the shared contract suite, and every superseded copy is
deleted. Anything not listed under "Known intentional differences" is a
regression.

The first executable renderer-neutral suite lives in
`@tweeq/test-contracts` and runs the same InputSwitch controlled-value and
keyboard/confirm contract against both React and Vue.

## Baseline record (Phase 0 gate)

Captured on `feat/monorepo` at `d859bed` with Node 24.16.0 / yarn 1.x:

| Check | Result |
| --- | --- |
| `yarn build` (React library, Vite lib mode) | ✅ builds `lib/` (ES + CJS + d.ts) |
| `yarn build:demo` (React docs demo, Pages artifact) | ✅ builds `demo/dist` |
| `yarn vitest run` (core unit tests) | ✅ 22 files, 86 tests |
| Playwright e2e (`yarn e2e`, Chromium) | 13 spec files covering primitives, numbers/vectors, temporal, rotary, dropdown/code, color/curves, overlays, text/toggles, layout/modals, docs pages, mobile widths |
| Vue renderer | ⚠️ dormant: SFCs are byte-identical to `upstream/main` but are not built by the current toolchain (no `vue`/`pinia` in the manifest) |
| Public demo | GitHub Pages, deployed from `feat/react` via `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` |

The Vue column below therefore describes the **upstream-frozen** behavior; its
build is restored in Phase 2 (Stage V1) inside `packages/vue`.

## Component families

Columns: **Core** = framework-neutral logic module in `src/core` shared *today*
by both implementations (`—` = logic still duplicated in renderer code);
**E2E** = Playwright specs exercising the React implementation.

## Non-component surface

| Surface | Vue | React | Target owner |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `initTweeq` / `useTweeq` | plugin + composable | `initTweeq` + `useTweeq` hook | renderer adapters over shared store factories |
| Stores: actions, appConfig, modal, multiSelect, theme | Vue compatibility facades over shared stores | zustand-vanilla stores | **done 2026-07-13**: both renderers consume the `@tweeq/dom` instances; Vue adapters add refs and lifecycle disposal without duplicating state transitions |
| Theme generation | ~~`src/theme`~~ → shared | `core/theme` | **done 2026-07-13**: both renderers compute via `@tweeq/core` `computeTheme`, apply via `@tweeq/dom` `applyThemeToDOM`, and subscribe to the same `themeStore` |
| Composables/hooks: useBndr, useFlash, useDrag, useCursorStyle, … | `src/use` | `src/react/hooks` | thin adapters over `@tweeq/dom` controllers |
| Gesture engine | Vue ref adapter over `createDragHandler` | React hook over `createDragHandler` | **done 2026-07-13**: pointer state transitions and thresholds live in `@tweeq/dom`; renderer adapters only publish reactive snapshots and lifecycle disposal |
| Validators/formatting | ~~local copies~~ → shared | `core/validator`, `core/util` | **done 2026-07-13**: Vue's `util.ts`/`validator.ts` are re-export shims over `@tweeq/core`/`@tweeq/dom` |
| Styling | scoped Stylus per SFC + `common.styl` | CSS Modules per component | `@tweeq/styles` parts (Phase 3+) |

## Known intentional differences

1. **Controlled-value convention**: React `value`/`onChange` vs Vue
   `modelValue`/`update:modelValue`. Permanent, per architecture rule 2.
2. **Provider bootstrapping**: React `TweeqProvider`/`initTweeq` vs Vue plugin
   `initTweeq(app)`. Permanent.
3. **Monaco/Iconify wrappers**: framework-specific wrapper packages remain in
   each renderer.
4. **Store adapters**: both renderers use the shared zustand-vanilla stores.
   Vue exposes framework-native refs and lifecycle disposal around those same
   instances; its temporary Pinia compatibility layer was removed in Stage V4.
5. **Slots vs render props** for Menu, panes, ParameterGrid, Tooltip content.
   Permanent, per architecture rule 2.

### Converged during Phase 3

- `replaceTimecodeWithFrames`: legacy Vue parsed comma timecodes inside
  expressions at a hardcoded 24 fps; both renderers now use the shared core
  implementation, which honors the actual `frameRate` (fixture:
  `core/src/inputTime.test.ts`, `'1:00', 30 → '30'`).

## Protected fixtures (Phase 0)

These test files encode edge-case behavior that must not change without an
explicit parity-matrix entry. They migrate verbatim into `@tweeq/core` /
`@tweeq/test-contracts`:

- `src/core/inputNumber.test.ts` — decimal precision, drag scaling, ranges
- `src/core/inputTime.test.ts` — timecode parsing, frame quantization
- `src/core/inputRotary.test.ts`, `src/core/inputDrum.test.ts` — angular/drum
  transitions and snapping
- `src/core/inputSize.test.ts`, `src/core/inputTranslate.test.ts`,
  `src/core/inputSwitch.test.ts`, `src/core/inputShuffle.ts` fixtures
- `src/core/dropdown.test.ts`, `src/core/menu.test.ts` — selection semantics
- `src/core/color.test.ts`, `src/core/cubicBezier.test.ts`
- `src/core/popover.test.ts`, `src/core/balloon.test.ts`,
  `src/core/panes.test.ts`, `src/core/timeline.test.ts`,
  `src/core/geometry.test.ts`, `src/core/drag.test.ts`
- `src/core/stores/appConfig.test.ts` — persistence namespacing
- `e2e/*.spec.ts` — 13 Playwright specs (interaction-level baseline)

## Deletion checklist (Stage V4)

Track compatibility code here instead of TODO comments. Format: item,
introduced-in, removal criteria, status.

| Item | Introduced | Removal criteria | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `packages/react/src/core/index.ts` barrel forwarding `@tweeq/core` + `@tweeq/dom` | Phase 2 (React relocation) | every React source imports the owner explicitly; renderer entry preserves convenience exports directly from the owning packages | **done 2026-07-13**: all internal consumers migrated and the local barrel deleted |
| `packages/react/src/common.styl` stylus forwarder to `@tweeq/styles` | Phase 2 (React relocation) | no renderer stylesheet imports the forwarder; source-building Vite configs inject the owned mixins by absolute path | **done 2026-07-13** via shared `scripts/vite-stylus.ts` configuration |
| `packages/vue/src/common.styl` stylus forwarder to `@tweeq/styles` | Phase 2 (Vue relocation) | no renderer stylesheet imports the forwarder; source-building Vite configs inject the owned mixins by absolute path | **done 2026-07-13** via shared `scripts/vite-stylus.ts` configuration |
| Pinia stores and component-local contexts in `packages/vue` | upstream legacy, kept in Stage V1 | app stores use shared instances; local contexts become plain Vue/module state; `rg "pinia\|defineStore\|createPinia" packages/vue apps/playground-vue examples/vue-vite` is empty | **done 2026-07-13**: actions, appConfig, modal, multiSelect, and theme share DOM stores; InputTime and regl no longer require Pinia |
| Duplicated pure logic in `packages/vue/src/` (`util.ts`, `validator.ts`, `theme/`, per-component `utils.ts`) | upstream legacy, kept in Stage V1 | Vue and React call the shared core/controller implementations without copied transitions | **done 2026-07-13** for util, validator, theme, timecode, CubicBezierValue, InputShuffle, InputColor, InputSwitch, and InputRotary |
| Re-export shims left by Stage V2 (`packages/vue/src/{util,validator}.ts`, `InputTime/utils.ts` function re-exports, `InputCubicBezier/util.ts`, `InputShuffle/generators.ts`) | Phase 3 leaf replacement | Vue callers import owning packages directly; shim files deleted when `rg "from '\.\./(util|validator)'" packages/vue/src` is empty | **done 2026-07-13**: public compatibility exports now forward from the package entry points without renderer-local files |
| Legacy vue-tsc diagnostics in `@tweeq/vue` build (non-fatal, pre-existing upstream typing issues) | Stage V1 build restoration | declaration generation completes without TypeScript diagnostics | **done 2026-07-13**: recursive Menu refs/props, readonly color axes, generic vector bounds, event overloads, and element/style typing corrected |

## Phase 4 family status

| Family | Status | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1. primitives, icons, groups, buttons, switches | **done 2026-07-13** | shared contracts run against both renderers for InputButton, InputButtonToggle, InputSwitch, InputCheckbox, InputGroup, and IconIndicator; Icon source parsing has core fixtures; BindIcon/SvgIcon remain renderer-only markup; packed examples and relevant Playwright specs pass |
| 2. text and dropdown controls | **done 2026-07-13** | InputString and InputDropdown shared contracts run against both renderers; expression compilation, label generation, placement, and wrap/empty navigation are core-owned; packed examples and text/dropdown Playwright specs pass |
| 3. number and vector controls | **done 2026-07-13** | InputNumber and InputTranslate shared contracts run against both renderers; expression evaluation, translate geometry, and size ratio behavior are core-owned; InputVec and InputPosition propagate controlled bounds and input state consistently; number/vector Playwright coverage protects the composed controls |
| 4. rotary, angle, drum, ruler, time, timeline | **done 2026-07-13** | shared contracts run against both renderers for InputTime, InputDrum, InputRotary, Ruler, and Timeline; InputAngle composes contracted controls; expression, snap/drag, selection, scale, and range transitions are core-owned; temporal and rotary Playwright coverage passes |
| 5. popover, tooltip, menus, command palette, multi-select | **done 2026-07-13** | Menu and Popover shared contracts run against both renderers; Tooltip and MultiSelect state machines are DOM-owned with controller fixtures; CommandPalette history/navigation is core-owned and actions preserve shared lifecycle hooks; overlay/dropdown Playwright coverage passes |

## Retrospective gate repair (2026-07-13)

The Phase 0–2 completion audit found that Vite-based consumers had masked
bundler-only ESM resolution and Vue import-time browser effects. Core and DOM
now emit Node-resolvable `.js` specifiers; Vue defers WebGL and Monaco browser
initialization, no longer imports the SSR-unsafe Pave package, and excludes
contract tests from declarations. CI now runs plain-Node entry imports, the
full Playwright suite, and representative light/dark/mobile screenshots.

## Stage V1 completion note (2026-07-13)

The Vue renderer builds again as `@tweeq/vue` (ES + CJS + browser UMD + `style.css` +
declarations). The original relocation baseline was verified with shared-asset
seams for InputColor shaders and Stylus; later stages replaced those temporary
seams with owned package imports and shared Vite injection. Verified by
`apps/playground-vue` booting with zero console errors and by the packed
`examples/vue-vite` build.
